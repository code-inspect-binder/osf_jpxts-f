MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Well-being is predicted by TVC, the slope is random
S1 | WB ON TVC;
! Well-being is predicted by TCE, the slope is random
S2 | WB ON TCE;
! Well-being is predicted by SN, the slope is random
S3 | WB ON SN;
! Control for weekend
WB ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
WB S1-S3 WITH WB S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by TVC
WB ON TVC;
! The intercept is predicted by TCE
WB ON TCE;
! The intercept is predicted by SN
WB ON SN;
! The intercept is predicted by openness
WB ON O;
! The slopes are predicted by openness
S1-S3 ON O;
