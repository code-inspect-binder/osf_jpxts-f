MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Well-being is predicted by TCE, the slope is random
S1 | WB ON TCE;
! Well-being is predicted by SN, the slope is random
S2 | WB ON SN;
! Well-being is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | WB ON family;
! Well-being is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | WB ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
WB ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
WB S1-S4 WITH WB S1-S4;
! The intercept is predicted by neuroticism
WB ON N;
! The slopes are predicted by neuroticism
S1-S4 ON N;
