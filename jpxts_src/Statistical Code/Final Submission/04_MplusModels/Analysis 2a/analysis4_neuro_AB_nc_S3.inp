MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Affect balance is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S1 | AB ON CMC;
! Affect balance is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S2 | AB ON mixed;
! Affect balance is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | AB ON family;
! Affect balance is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | AB ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
AB ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
AB S1-S4 WITH AB S1-S4;
! The intercept is predicted by neuroticism
AB ON N;
! The slopes are predicted by neuroticism
S1-S4 ON N;
