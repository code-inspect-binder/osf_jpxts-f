MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Loneliness is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S1 | lonely ON CMC;
! Loneliness is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S2 | lonely ON mixed;
! Loneliness is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | lonely ON family;
! Loneliness is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | lonely ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
lonely ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
lonely S1-S4 WITH lonely S1-S4;
! The intercept is predicted by neuroticism
lonely ON N;
! The slopes are predicted by neuroticism
S1-S4 ON N;
