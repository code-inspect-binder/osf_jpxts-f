MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Well-being is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S1 | WB ON CMC;
! Well-being is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S2 | WB ON mixed;
! Well-being is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | WB ON family;
! Well-being is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | WB ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
WB ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
WB S1-S4 WITH WB S1-S4;
! The intercept is predicted by conscientiousness
WB ON C;
! The slopes are predicted by conscientiousness
S1-S4 ON C;
