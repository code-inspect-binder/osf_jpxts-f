%WITHIN%
! Happiness is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S1 | happy ON CMC;
! Happiness is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S2 | happy ON mixed;
! Happiness is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | happy ON family;
! Happiness is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | happy ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
happy ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
happy S1-S4 WITH happy S1-S4;
! The intercept is predicted by extraversion
happy ON E;
! The slopes are predicted by extraversion
S1-S4 ON E;
