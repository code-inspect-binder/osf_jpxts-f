MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Sadness is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S1 | sad ON CMC;
! Sadness is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S2 | sad ON mixed;
! Sadness is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | sad ON family;
! Sadness is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | sad ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
sad ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
sad S1-S4 WITH sad S1-S4;
! The intercept is predicted by neuroticism
sad ON N;
! The slopes are predicted by neuroticism
S1-S4 ON N;
