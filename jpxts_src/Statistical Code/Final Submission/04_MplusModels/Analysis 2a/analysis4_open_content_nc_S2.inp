MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Contentment is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S1 | content ON CMC;
! Contentment is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S2 | content ON mixed;
! Contentment is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | content ON family;
! Contentment is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | content ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
content ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
content S1-S4 WITH content S1-S4;
! The intercept is predicted by openness
content ON O;
! The slopes are predicted by openness
