%WITHIN%
! Anger is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S1 | angry ON CMC;
! Anger is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S2 | angry ON mixed;
! Anger is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | angry ON family;
! Anger is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | angry ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
angry ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
angry S1-S4 WITH angry S1-S4;
! The intercept is predicted by neuroticism
angry ON N;
! The slopes are predicted by neuroticism
