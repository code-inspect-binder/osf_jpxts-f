MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Well-being is predicted by FtF interactions, the slope is random
S1 | WB ON FTF;
! Well-being is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S2 | WB ON CMC;
! Well-being is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S3 | WB ON mixed;
! Control for weekend
WB ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
WB S1-S3 WITH WB S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by FtF interactions
WB ON FTF;
! The intercept is predicted by CMC
WB ON CMC;
! The intercept is predicted by mixed episodes
WB ON mixed;
! The intercept is predicted by extraversion
WB ON E;
! The slopes are predicted by extraversion
S1-S3 ON E;
