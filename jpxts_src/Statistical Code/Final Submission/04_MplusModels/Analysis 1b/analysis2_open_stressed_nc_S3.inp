MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Stress is predicted by FtF interactions, the slope is random
S1 | stressed ON FTF;
! Stress is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S2 | stressed ON CMC;
! Stress is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S3 | stressed ON mixed;
! Control for weekend
stressed ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
stressed S1-S3 WITH stressed S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by FtF interactions
stressed ON FTF;
! The intercept is predicted by CMC
stressed ON CMC;
! The intercept is predicted by mixed episodes
stressed ON mixed;
! The intercept is predicted by openness
stressed ON O;
! The slopes are predicted by openness
S1-S3 ON O;
