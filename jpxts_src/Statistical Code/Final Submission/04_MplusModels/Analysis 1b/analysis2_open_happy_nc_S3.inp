MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Happiness is predicted by FtF interactions, the slope is random
S1 | happy ON FTF;
! Happiness is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S2 | happy ON CMC;
! Happiness is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S3 | happy ON mixed;
! Control for weekend
happy ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
happy S1-S3 WITH happy S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by FtF interactions
happy ON FTF;
! The intercept is predicted by CMC
happy ON CMC;
! The intercept is predicted by mixed episodes
happy ON mixed;
! The intercept is predicted by openness
happy ON O;
! The slopes are predicted by openness
S1-S3 ON O;
