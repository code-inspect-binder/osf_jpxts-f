MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Anger is predicted by FtF interactions, the slope is random
S1 | angry ON FTF;
! Anger is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S2 | angry ON CMC;
! Anger is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S3 | angry ON mixed;
! Control for weekend
angry ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
angry S1-S3 WITH angry S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by FtF interactions
angry ON FTF;
! The intercept is predicted by CMC
angry ON CMC;
! The intercept is predicted by mixed episodes
angry ON mixed;
! The intercept is predicted by openness
angry ON O;
! The slopes are predicted by openness
