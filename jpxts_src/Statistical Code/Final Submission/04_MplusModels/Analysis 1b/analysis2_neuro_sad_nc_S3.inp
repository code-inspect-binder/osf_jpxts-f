MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Sadness is predicted by FtF interactions, the slope is random
S1 | sad ON FTF;
! Sadness is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S2 | sad ON CMC;
! Sadness is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S3 | sad ON mixed;
! Control for weekend
sad ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
sad S1-S3 WITH sad S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by FtF interactions
sad ON FTF;
! The intercept is predicted by CMC
sad ON CMC;
! The intercept is predicted by mixed episodes
sad ON mixed;
! The intercept is predicted by neuroticism
sad ON N;
! The slopes are predicted by neuroticism
S1-S3 ON N;
