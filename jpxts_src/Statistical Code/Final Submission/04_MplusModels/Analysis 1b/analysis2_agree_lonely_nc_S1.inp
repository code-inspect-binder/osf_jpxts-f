MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Loneliness is predicted by FtF interactions, the slope is random
S1 | lonely ON FTF;
! Loneliness is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S2 | lonely ON CMC;
! Loneliness is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S3 | lonely ON mixed;
! Control for weekend
lonely ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
lonely S1-S3 WITH lonely S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by FtF interactions
lonely ON FTF;
! The intercept is predicted by CMC
lonely ON CMC;
! The intercept is predicted by mixed episodes
lonely ON mixed;
! The intercept is predicted by agreeableness
lonely ON A;
! The slopes are predicted by agreeableness
S1-S3 ON A;
