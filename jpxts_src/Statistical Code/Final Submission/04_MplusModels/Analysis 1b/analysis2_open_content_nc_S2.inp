MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Contentment is predicted by FtF interactions, the slope is random
S1 | content ON FTF;
! Contentment is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S2 | content ON CMC;
! Contentment is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S3 | content ON mixed;
! Control for weekend
content ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
content S1-S3 WITH content S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by FtF interactions
content ON FTF;
! The intercept is predicted by CMC
content ON CMC;
! The intercept is predicted by mixed episodes
content ON mixed;
! The intercept is predicted by openness
content ON O;
! The slopes are predicted by openness
S1-S3 ON O;
