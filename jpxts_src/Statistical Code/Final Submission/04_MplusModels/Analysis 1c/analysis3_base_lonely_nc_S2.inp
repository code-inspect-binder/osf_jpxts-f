MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Loneliness is predicted by peers, the slope is random
S1 | lonely ON peers;
! Loneliness is predicted by family, the slope is random
S2 | lonely ON family;
! Loneliness is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S3 | lonely ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
lonely ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
lonely S1-S3 WITH lonely S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by peers
lonely ON peers;
! The intercept is predicted by family
lonely ON family;
! The intercept is predicted by weak ties
