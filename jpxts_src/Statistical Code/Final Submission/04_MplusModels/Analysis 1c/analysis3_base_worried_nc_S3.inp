%WITHIN%
! Worry is predicted by peers, the slope is random
S1 | worried ON peers;
! Worry is predicted by family, the slope is random
S2 | worried ON family;
! Worry is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S3 | worried ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
worried ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
worried S1-S3 WITH worried S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by peers
worried ON peers;
! The intercept is predicted by family
worried ON family;
! The intercept is predicted by weak ties
