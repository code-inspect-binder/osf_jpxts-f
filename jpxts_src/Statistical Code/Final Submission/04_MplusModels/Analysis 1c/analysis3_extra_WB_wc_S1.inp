MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Well-being is predicted by peers, the slope is random
S1 | WB ON peers;
! Well-being is predicted by family, the slope is random
S2 | WB ON family;
! Well-being is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S3 | WB ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
WB ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
WB S1-S3 WITH WB S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by peers
WB ON peers;
! The intercept is predicted by family
WB ON family;
! The intercept is predicted by weak ties
WB ON weak_ties;
! The intercept is predicted by extraversion
WB ON E;
! The slopes are predicted by extraversion
S1-S3 ON E;
! Control for demographic variables
