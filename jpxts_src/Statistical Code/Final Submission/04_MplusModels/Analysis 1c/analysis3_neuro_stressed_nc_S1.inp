MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Stress is predicted by peers, the slope is random
S1 | stressed ON peers;
! Stress is predicted by family, the slope is random
S2 | stressed ON family;
! Stress is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S3 | stressed ON weak_ties;
! Control for weekend
stressed ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
stressed S1-S3 WITH stressed S1-S3;
! The intercept is predicted by peers
stressed ON peers;
! The intercept is predicted by family
stressed ON family;
! The intercept is predicted by weak ties
stressed ON weak_ties;
! The intercept is predicted by neuroticism
stressed ON N;
! The slopes are predicted by neuroticism
