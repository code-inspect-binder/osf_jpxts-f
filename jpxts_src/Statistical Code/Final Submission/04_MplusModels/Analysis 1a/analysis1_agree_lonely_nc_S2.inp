%WITHIN%
! Loneliness is predicted by social interactions, the slope is random
S1 | lonely ON int;
! Control for weekend
lonely ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slope
lonely WITH S1;
! The intercept is predicted by social interactions
lonely ON int;
! The intercept is predicted by agreeableness
lonely ON A;
! The slope is predicted by agreeableness
