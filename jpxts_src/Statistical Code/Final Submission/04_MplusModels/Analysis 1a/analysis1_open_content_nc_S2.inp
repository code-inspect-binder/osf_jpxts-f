MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Contentment is predicted by social interactions, the slope is random
S1 | content ON int;
! Control for weekend
content ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slope
content WITH S1;
! The intercept is predicted by social interactions
content ON int;
! The intercept is predicted by openness
content ON O;
! The slope is predicted by openness
