%WITHIN%
! Well-being is predicted by social interactions, the slope is random
S1 | WB ON int;
! Control for weekend
WB ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slope
WB WITH S1;
! The intercept is predicted by social interactions
WB ON int;
! The intercept is predicted by neuroticism
WB ON N;
! The slope is predicted by neuroticism
