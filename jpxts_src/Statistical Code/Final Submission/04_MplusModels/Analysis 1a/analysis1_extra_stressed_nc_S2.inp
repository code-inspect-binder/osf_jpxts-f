MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Stress is predicted by social interactions, the slope is random
S1 | stressed ON int;
! Control for weekend
stressed ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slope
stressed WITH S1;
! The intercept is predicted by social interactions
stressed ON int;
! The intercept is predicted by extraversion
stressed ON E;
! The slope is predicted by extraversion
