%WITHIN%
! Affect balance is predicted by social interactions, the slope is random
S1 | AB ON int;
! Control for weekend
AB ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slope
AB WITH S1;
! The intercept is predicted by social interactions
AB ON int;
! The intercept is predicted by extraversion
AB ON E;
! The slope is predicted by extraversion
S1 ON E;
! Control for demographic variables
