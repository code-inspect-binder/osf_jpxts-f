MODEL:
%WITHIN%
! Loneliness is predicted by CMC, the slope is random
S1 | lonely ON CMC;
! Loneliness is predicted by mixed episodes, the slope is random
S2 | lonely ON mixed;
! Loneliness is predicted by family, the slope is random
S3 | lonely ON family;
! Loneliness is predicted by weak ties, the slope is random
S4 | lonely ON weak_ties;
! Loneliness is predicted by CMC*family, the slope is random
S5 | lonely ON cxf;
! Loneliness is predicted by CMC*weak ties, the slope is random
S6 | lonely ON cxw;
! Loneliness is predicted by mixed*family, the slope is random
S7 | lonely ON mxf;
! Loneliness is predicted by mixed*weak ties, the slope is random
S8 | lonely ON mxw;
! Control for weekend
lonely ON weekend;
%BETWEEN%
! Covariance between intercept and slopes
lonely S1-S8 WITH lonely S1-S8;
! The intercept is predicted by openness
lonely ON O;
! The slopes are predicted by openness
